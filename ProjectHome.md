Radio433 is a arduino library made to turn more easy the process of data transference between low cost ASK radio frequency modules. This library also allows transmit addressable data to only one or some receivers.
The functions are intuitives and easy to use. Your code will get more clean, and you will write it faster.

Radio433 provides: variable length messages (sent by packets), easy message content conversion,adressable messages,intuitive functions (good for beginners),and "cipher text" mode (substitution cipher based on single key).

This library is based on Mike McCauley's  VirtualWire library, and uses its code to interface with hardware, so if you want to understand more about the process of communication I recommend to read VirtualWire documentation at the follows link:
